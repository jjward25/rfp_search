Design and maintain core features and infrastructure. Given the size of the team, you will be working across the entire product and will have lots of responsibility.</li><li>Collaborate &amp; learn.

We're focused on building a high-trust, ownership focused environment where everyone aims to define what they think is most important to work on, and drive initiatives forward.</li><li>Interview users, analyze feedback, help prioritize the roadmap. Set up, run, and synthesize learnings from user research studies to help inform what use cases and improvements we should focus on.</li><li>Design &amp; prototype novel interfaces. You'll rethink how we can make certain aspects of building software more intuitive to users, which requires you to deeply understand what building software looks like today. This could involve quickly building lightweight prototypes to explore novel interaction patterns that make building software efficient and intuitive.<br/><br/></li></ul>What You'll Bring<br/><br/><ul><li>Clear design process. You can identify the right problems to solve, consider multiple solutions, and speak intelligently about tradeoffs. You develop personal and shared processes in service of a shared higher-level goal, not just for the sake of having a process.</li><li>Excellent communication &amp; collaboration. You’re able to consider different levels of abstraction so your ideas land with your audience. You default to visual communication, but also have excellent verbal and written communication skills. You’re organized and comfortable with both synchronous and asynchronous communication.</li><li>Systems thinking. You can break down complex problems and expose simple interfaces for accomplishing difficult tasks. You see patterns that repeat across the product and are able to abstract them into common interactions. For example, if we auto-fill the best values into certain fields in the product, how can we adapt the same functionality across contexts into the rest of the product?</li><li>Ability to deliver pixel-perfect designs. You care about coming back to something again and again until ""it feels right"", and you inspire your engineering partners to have the same level of care.</li><li>Thinking in interactions, not static screens. You embody the belief that software is not a set of static screens, but rather a responsive system that evolves over time. You deeply understand the nuances of designing for such a medium.</li><li>A customer-focused approach to design.
